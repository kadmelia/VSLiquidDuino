## What is it ?
A little experimentation with Visual C#, Arduino and a 16x2 LCD.

In two words : how to print a message on a LCD with Visual C# and an Arduino.

## But, why did you do this ???

Ehh, good question. I don't know. I like Arduino and I was curious about
Visua C#.

## Installation

- Connect you LCD according to http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystal
- Connect your Arduino to your computer
- Open the INO file with Arduino IDE
- Compile and upload it on the Arduino
- Build Visual C# project
- Enjoy
